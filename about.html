<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> My name is Roberta Vantu and I work as a supplier consultant/material analyst. </p>
I am 23 years old, going 24 this year (2024) and I must say that I am quite dissapointed that I haven't found my "path" yet. I really like web developing though and I am trying to become one.
<p>I haven't graduated any programming college nor I have any programming backround. I graduated Tourism in HighSchool and after a Journalism Faculty. I don't know what Journalism has to do with Web Developing but in my last year I learnt the basics of Web Developing. This was the start of my passion for programming.</p>
<p>Since then, I tried to buy so many courses regarding Web Developing or join online or on site courses but I must say: they're so expensive that I cannot afford it... I honestly can't join a programming University because my last experience with University is not what I expected so I don't feel like I could do 4 more years do get a degree.</p>
Although it took me 2 years to gain courage and start a Web Developing course like this one, I don't regret a thing. I still believe this was the best choice for me right now. Since I started this course it reminded me how much I really love programming.
<p>I think I said a lot for now, at least. Until we see each other again, maybe I changed my mind and will graduate a programming University too, who knows. I wish you the best! Hugs and kisses!</p>
